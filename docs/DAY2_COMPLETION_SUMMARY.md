**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## Objectives Achieved

**Data Location**: `/data/intraday/5min/SPY.csv`

**Data Quality Metrics**:
- **Shape**: 4,246 bars × 19 columns
- **Date Range**: September 8, 2025 to October 7, 2025 (1 month)
- **Trading Days**: 22 days
- **Average Daily Volume**: 79,552,356 shares
- **Price Range**: $467.97 - $673.11

**Available Columns**:
- OHLCV data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
- Pre-calculated indicators (RSI_14, SMA_20, SMA_50, EMA_9, EMA_21)
- Bollinger Bands (BB_Middle, BB_Upper, BB_Lower)
- ATR, VWAP, Returns
- Volume metrics (Volume_SMA, Volume_Ratio)

**Data Validation**: ✅ **PASSED**
- No duplicate timestamps
- Sorted chronologically
- Minimal missing values
- Reasonable price and volume ranges

---

### ✅ 2. Test Opening Range Calculation on Real Data

**Opening Range Configuration**:
- **OR Period**: 15 minutes (9:30 AM - 9:45 AM)
- **Minimum OR Range**: 0.2% of price
- **Validation**: Range must meet minimum threshold

**Results**:
- **Total Bars**: 4,246
- **Bars with OR Calculated**: 4,246 (100%)
- **Valid Opening Ranges**: 1,351 bars across 7 trading days

**Sample Opening Ranges** (First 7 valid days):
| Date | OR High | OR Low | OR Range | Range % |
|------|---------|--------|----------|---------|
| 2025-09-18 | $660.62 | $658.94 | $1.68 | 0.25% |
| 2025-09-25 | $657.98 | $655.08 | $2.90 | 0.44% |
| 2025-09-26 | $661.69 | $658.92 | $2.77 | 0.42% |
| 2025-10-01 | $665.39 | $663.12 | $2.26 | 0.34% |
| 2025-10-02 | $670.57 | $668.88 | $1.68 | 0.25% |
| 2025-10-03 | $671.33 | $669.93 | $1.40 | 0.21% |
| 2025-10-06 | $671.65 | $670.06 | $1.59 | 0.24% |

**OR Range Statistics**:
- **Average**: $2.04
- **Min**: $1.40
- **Max**: $2.90
- **Std Dev**: $0.60

**Findings**:
- ✅ Opening ranges calculating correctly
- ✅ OR validation working (filtering out narrow ranges)
- ⚠️ Only 7 days with valid OR out of 22 trading days (31.8% validity rate)
- **Issue**: Many days filtered out due to 0.2% minimum range requirement being too strict

---

### ✅ 3. Verify Signal Generation Logic

**Signal Generation Results**:
- **Long Signals**: 3
- **Short Signals**: 0
- **Total Signals**: 3
- **Signals Per Day**: 0.14 (very conservative)

**Signal Examples**:
| Date/Time | Direction | Close | OR High | OR Low | Volume |
|-----------|-----------|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2025-09-18 13:10:00 | LONG | $661.93 | $660.62 | $658.94 | 1,350,890 |
| 2025-10-01 14:00:00 | LONG | $668.23 | $665.39 | $663.12 | 923,823 |
| 2025-10-03 11:55:00 | LONG | $672.50 | $671.33 | $669.93 | 1,018,734 |

**Signal Validation**:
- ✅ 2-bar confirmation logic working
- ✅ Volume filter (1.5x) working
- ✅ Breakout buffer (0.05%) applied correctly
- ✅ Trading window restriction (9:45 AM - 3:30 PM) enforced
- ✅ One signal per day limit respected

**Findings**:
- ⚠️ Very few signals generated (3 in 22 days)
- ⚠️ All signals are LONG (no SHORT signals)
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Volume filter (1.5x) may be too restrictive
  - ATR filter filtering out many breakouts
  - Limited valid OR days (only 7 days)
  - Gap filter may be excluding opportunities
  - Market trending down during test period?

### ✅ 5. Analyze Initial Results and Identify Issues

#### Critical Issues Identified

**1. Win Rate: 0.0%** ⚠️⚠️⚠️
- **Target**: 40-55%
- **Actual**: 0%
- **Impact**: All 3 trades lost money
- **Likely Causes**:
  - Small sample size (only 3 trades)
  - Entry timing may be too early (catching false breakouts)
  - Stop loss too tight (0.75x OR range)
  - Market conditions unfavorable (trending down?)

**2. Very Few Signals (3 in 22 days)** ⚠️⚠️
- **Expected**: ~20-30 signals per month (0.7-1.0 per day)
- **Actual**: 0.14 signals per day
- **Root Causes**:
  - Only 7 valid OR days (31.8% of days)
  - MIN_OR_RANGE_PCT = 0.2% too restrictive
  - VOLUME_MULTIPLIER = 1.5x filtering out many signals
  - ATR filter may be too strict
  - GAP_PCT filter excluding days

**3. Profit Factor: 0.00** ⚠️⚠️
- **Target**: > 1.5
- **Actual**: 0.00 (no winning trades)
- **Meaning**: Strategy is losing money

**4. No Profit Target Hits** ⚠️
- 0 trades reached any profit target (1x, 1.5x, or 2x OR)
- All exits via stop loss or time stop
- Suggests targets may be unrealistic or entry quality poor

**5. Only LONG Signals**
- No SHORT signals generated
- May indicate:
  - Market was trending up (no downside breakouts)
  - Short signal logic not triggered
  - Volume/ATR filters blocking short signals

#### Performance vs. Targets

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Win Rate | 40-55% | 0.0% | ❌ FAIL |
| Profit Factor | > 1.5 | 0.00 | ❌ FAIL |
| Sharpe Ratio | > 1.5 | 0.05 | ❌ FAIL |
| Max Drawdown | < 15% | 14.90% | ✅ PASS |
| Avg R-Multiple | > 1.0 | -0.91 | ❌ FAIL |
| Signals Per Day | 0.7-1.0 | 0.14 | ❌ FAIL |

**Overall**: **1 out of 6 metrics passed** ⚠️

## Recommendations for Day 3

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Relax MIN_OR_RANGE_PCT** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
   - Current: 0.2% (0.002)
   - Suggested: 0.1% or 0.15%
   - Expected Impact: More valid OR days, more signals

2. **Lower VOLUME_MULTIPLIER** ⚠️ **HIGH**
   - Current: 1.5x
   - Suggested: 1.2x or 1.3x
   - Expected Impact: More signals pass volume filter

3. **Test on Longer Time Period** ⚠️ **HIGH**
   - Current: 1 month (22 days)
   - Suggested: 3-6 months
   - Expected Impact: More trades, better statistical significance

4. **Review Stop Loss Settings**
   - Current: 0.75x OR range
   - Consider: Testing 1.0x or 1.25x OR range
   - Risk: May increase losses per trade but reduce stop-outs

5. **Analyze Market Conditions**
   - Check if September-October 2025 was trending down
   - Verify if ORB works better in certain market regimes
   - Consider adding trend filter (EMA alignment)

### Secondary Actions (Medium Priority)

6. **Review Entry Timing**
   - Current: 2-bar confirmation
   - Consider: Test 1-bar vs 3-bar confirmation
   - Investigate: Entry on 3rd bar vs 2nd bar

7. **Adjust Profit Targets**
   - None of 3 trades hit 1.0x OR target
   - Consider: Lower first target to 0.75x OR
   - Test: Different target combinations

8. **Enable SHORT Signals**
   - Investigate why no short signals
   - Test: Are volume/ATR requirements different for shorts?
   - Consider: Separate filter thresholds for long/short

9. **Add Trend Filter** (from enhanced plan)
   - Implement: EMA alignment (9/21 cross)
   - Test: Only take longs if price > EMA21
   - Expected: Higher win rate, fewer trades

### Testing Protocol for Day 3

**Step 1: Quick Wins** (30 minutes)
- [ ] Lower MIN_OR_RANGE_PCT to 0.10%

- [ ] Grid search: VOLUME_MULTIPLIER (1.0x, 1.2x, 1.5x)
- [ ] Grid search: CONFIRMATION_BARS (1, 2, 3)
- [ ] Find optimal combination

**Step 4: Test on Other Symbols** (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Run backtest on QQQ
- [ ] Run backtest on TSLA (if available)

## Day 2 Checklist Status

- [x] Load and validate SPY 5-min data
- [x] Test opening range calculation on real data
- [x] Verify signal generation logic
- [x] Run preliminary backtest
- [x] Analyze results and identify issues
- [x] Generate backtest report
- [x] Document findings and recommendations

## Key Insights

### 1. Small Sample Size Issue
With only 3 trades, results are **not statistically significant**. We need at least 30-50 trades to draw meaningful conclusions about strategy performance.

### 2. Filter Tuning Needed
The strategy filters are too restrictive:
- 68% of days filtered out by OR range requirement
- Volume multiplier (1.5x) may be excluding good opportunities
- Need to find balance between quality and quantity

### 3. Entry vs. Exit Imbalance
- Entries are highly selective (good)
- But all entries failed (bad)
- Suggests either poor entry timing or unrealistic targets

### 4. Market Context Matters
- September-October 2025 data may not represent typical conditions
- Need longer period to test across different market regimes
- Consider adding market regime detection

### 5. Short Strategy Untested
- No short signals generated
- Cannot evaluate short-side performance
- May need separate parameters for shorts

## Ready for Day 3

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Day 2 testing finished successfully

**Next Steps**:
1. Adjust filters (MIN_OR_RANGE_PCT, VOLUME_MULTIPLIER)
2. Test on longer period (3-6 months)
3. Parameter optimization via grid search
4. Multi-symbol testing (SPY, QQQ, TSLA)

**Critical Action Items for Day 3**:
- [ ] Fix filter parameters to generate more signals
- [ ] Extend test period to 3-6 months
- [ ] Achieve minimum 30+ trades for statistical significance
- [ ] Target 30%+ win rate minimum
- [ ] Reach profit factor > 1.0
