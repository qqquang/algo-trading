## Performance Considerations

### Data Loading Optimization:
- Use chunking for large datasets
- Implement caching layers
- Consider memory-mapped files for huge datasets
- Parallelize data processing where possible
- Use appropriate data types (float32 vs float64)

### Backtesting Speed:
- Vectorized operations over loops
- Pre-calculate indicators where possible
- Use compiled languages for critical paths (Cython, Numba)
- Implement incremental updates rather than full recalculations
